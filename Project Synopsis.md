# Project Synopsis

## Abstract
As a semester project for the module Introduction to C Programming Language at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts we decided to develop an audio visualization tool.

## Motivation
In our team we have some interest in audio processing and because C is a language that is often used in real-time application we decided it would be a good fit to develop an audio visualizer tool, that shows the audio as it is playing back in time.
